			I‘ve been drawing Moggel cartoons - on paper - since school days, especially during boring lessons.
			In 2022 I decided to go public with the Moggel stories. Looking for an independent, decentralized 
			platform that gives me control over my content, I found <a href="/deso">DeSo (Decentralized Social)</a>. 
			By now, I don‘t draw the cartoons on paper anymore; I use a tablet and a digital pen. However, I don‘t 
			use the benefits of a drawing app. I draw minimalistic, just like on paper, without any helping tools, 
			effects, and shortcuts.

			Hiya! I am Joshua and I've created this website. I've been into conding since I am 12 years old.
			I am currently studying games programming and I'll be done 2027. I work at a small flight simulator
			company as an administrator and I also do some simulator maintenance there. I've created this website
			for my dad, the comic artist. I've made this website with 100% pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not a
			single client-side framework was used. Why would I make my life hard? I don't know, but I thoght
			it could be a cool challenge, especially for a simple website like this.
